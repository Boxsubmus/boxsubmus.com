We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our games.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect, store, process, or share any personal data or personally identifiable information.

Our games:
- Do not require user accounts
- Do not request or access personal information
- Do not collect device identifiers or usage data
- Do not use analytics, telemetry, or crash reporting
- Do not connect to the internet in any way

All functionality operates entirely offline on the user’s device.

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services, SDKs, libraries, or tools that collect or process user data.  
Our games do not contain advertisements, in-app purchases, analytics frameworks, or online features.

## Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected at all, there is no personal information stored or shared.

## Data Security

We do not collect or store personal data. As a result, there is no user data to retain, transmit, or secure.

## Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy if our practices change. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
