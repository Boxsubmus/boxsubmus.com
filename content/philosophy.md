We make software following these rules:

## Not Sucking
Our software never gets in your way. We don't show popups, ads or beg for donations. Our software will never be released behind a paid subscription or any form of [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management).

## Prepared for the Future
Unlike most games made these days, all of our games (except Motionmelody), are created using our own custom game engine designed for simplicity and conciseness. This allows us to easily port our games to whatever platforms exist in twenty years without having to rely on a proprietary vendor.

## Freedom
All of our games' source code are released under the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). We do this so they can be studied, inspected and fixed by anyone. <small>*The assets for a game may still be proprietary in certain cases.</small>
